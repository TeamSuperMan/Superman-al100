                <h2>Historia</h2>
                <p>Superman was born on the planet Krypton and was given the name Kal-El at birth. When he was a baby, his parents, scientist Jor-El and his wife Lara Lor-Van, sent him to Earth in a small spaceship moments before Krypton was destroyed in a natural cataclysm. The ship landed in the American countryside near the fictional town of Smallville. He was found and adopted by farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent, who named him Clark Kent. Clark developed several superhuman abilities, such as incredible strength and waterproof skin. His adoptive parents advised him to use his abilities for the benefit of humanity and he decided to fight crime as a vigilante. </p>

                <h2>Poderes</h2>
                <p> To protect his privacy, he wears a colorful costume and uses the alias "Superman" when fighting crime. Although sometimes other superheroes refer to him unflatteringly as "the big blue Boy Scout," Superman is also known as "The Man of Steel," "The Man of Tomorrow" and "The Last Son of Krypton" to the general comic book audience. Under the identity of Clark Kent, Superman lives among humans as a "shy reporter" for Metropolis' Daily Planet newspaper.</p>
